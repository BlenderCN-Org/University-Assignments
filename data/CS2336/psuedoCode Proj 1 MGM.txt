int main()
	-Create File Reader
	-Create Vars to get a line, a name, and to gather how many cases we will be running through
	
	for(i = lines)
	-lines = how many cases in the file
		-getCoor(line) //Takes in a line param and seperates it into coordinate arrays
		-getArea(xCoor,yCoor)
	

	-toString // After everything is done, outprints results

void getCoor(string line)
	-Create a temp string to cycle through the variables on the line
	-Create a var to cycle through potential arrays
	-Create an Array for X-Coors
	-Create an Array for Y-Coors

	while(line != "")
	-Cycles through the line to seperate the x and y coors via substr
	-Assign temp to the first pair of coors
	-Substr temp up into the xCoor and yCoor Arrays
	-When the coors get put into the arrays, stop the loop, grab the next line

float getArea(array xCoor, array yCoor)
	-Calculates the area based on passed vars
	-Plugs into the function given and returns the value

	for(i < array.length)
	-Cycle through the series 

void toString()
	-Outprints the given data acoording to the rubric
