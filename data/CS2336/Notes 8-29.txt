JAVA vs C++

You can use intenger values in boolean statements, however it only looks at 0,1.
**Loops are very similar to Java in C++.
You can print out an array of chars if it ends with "\o" [a,b,c,d,e,\o].

PSEUDO CODE::

-Lay out the logic of the program.
EX) Function, Logic of a function, nothing specific but what its going to do.
-How to get from Point A to Point B. 
-It's a map instead of a trial / error approach.
-It's not always supposed to be correct, its just to show your understanding of how to tackle a problem.

**IN THE PSEUDO CODE**
-Every Function you plan to create.
	-What are you passing in.
	-What are you getting out.
	-What is it going to return.
	-What is the function going to do? (STEP BY STEP).
-Comment on what each variable is going to do, why its there.
-Submit as a PDF or Word Document or .txt
-You get 3 attempts to submit your Pseudo Code and your Project

**Look up pass by ref VS pass by val
