Deep learning has dramatically advanced the state of the art
in vision, speech, and many other areas. Stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) has proved to be an effective way of training
deep networks, and SGD variants such as momentum
(Sutskever et al., 2013) and Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011)
have been used to achieve state of the art performance.
SGD optimizes the parameters Θ of the network, so as to

where x1...N is the training data set. With SGD, the training
proceeds in steps, at each step considering a minibatch
x1...m of size m. Using mini-batches of examples,
as opposed to one example at a time, is helpful in several
ways. First, the gradient of the loss over a mini-batch

is an estimate of the gradient over the
training set, whose quality improves as the batch size increases.
Second, computation over a mini-batch can be
more efficient than m computations for individual examples
on modern computing platforms.
While stochastic gradient is simple and effective, it requires
careful tuning of the model hyper-parameters, specifically
the learning rate and the initial parameter values. The training
is complicated by the fact that the inputs to each layer
are affected by the parameters of all preceding layers – so
that small changes to the network parameters amplify as
the network becomes deeper.
The change in the distributions of layers’ inputs presents
a problem because the layers need to continuously adapt
to the new distribution. When the input distribution to a
learning system changes, it is said to experience covariate
shift (Shimodaira, 2000). This is typically handled via
domain adaptation (Jiang, 2008). However, the notion of
covariate shift can be extended beyond the learning system
as a whole, to apply to its parts, such as a sub-network or a
layer. Consider a network computing
` = F2(F1(u, Θ1), Θ2)
where F1 and F2 are arbitrary transformations, and the
parameters Θ1, Θ2 are to be learned so as to minimize
the loss `. Learning Θ2 can be viewed as if the inputs
x = F1(u, Θ1) are fed into the sub-network
` = F2(x, Θ2).
Batch Normalization
For example, a gradient descent step
Θ2 ← Θ2 −
α
m
Xm
i=1
∂F2(xi
, Θ2)
∂Θ2
(for mini-batch size m and learning rate α) is exactly equivalent
to that for a stand-alone network F2 with input x.
Therefore, the input distribution properties that aid the network
generalization – such as having the same distribution
between the training and test data – apply to training the
sub-network as well. As such it is advantageous for the
distribution of x to remain fixed over time. Then, Θ2 does
not have to readjust to compensate for the change in the
distribution of x.
Fixed distribution of inputs to a sub-network would have
positive consequences for the layers outside the subnetwork,
as well. Consider a layer with a sigmoid activation
function z = g(Wu + b) where u is the layer input,
the weight matrix W and bias vector b are the layer
parameters to be learned, and g(x) = 1
1+exp(−x)
. As |x|
increases, g
0
(x) tends to zero. This means that for all dimensions
of x = Wu + b except those with small absolute
values, the gradient flowing down to u will vanish and the
model will train slowly. However, since x is affected by
W, b and the parameters of all the layers below, changes to
those parameters during training will likely move many dimensions
of x into the saturated regime of the nonlinearity
and slow down the convergence. This effect is amplified
as the network depth increases. In practice, the saturation
problem and the resulting vanishing gradients are usually
addressed by using Rectified Linear Units (Nair & Hinton,
2010) ReLU(x) = max(x, 0), careful initialization (Bengio
& Glorot, 2010; Saxe et al., 2013), and small learning
rates. If, however, we could ensure that the distribution
of nonlinearity inputs remains more stable as the network
trains, then the optimizer would be less likely to get stuck
in the saturated regime, and the training would accelerate.
We refer to the change in the distributions of internal nodes
of a deep network, in the course of training, as Internal Covariate
Shift. Eliminating it offers a promise of faster training.
We propose a new mechanism, which we call Batch
Normalization, that takes a step towards reducing internal
covariate shift, and in doing so dramatically accelerates the
training of deep neural nets. It accomplishes this via a normalization
step that fixes the means and variances of layer
inputs. Batch Normalization also has a beneficial effect
on the gradient flow through the network, by reducing the
dependence of gradients on the scale of the parameters or
of their initial values. This allows us to use much higher
learning rates without the risk of divergence. Furthermore,
batch normalization regularizes the model and reduces the
need for Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014). Finally, Batch
Normalization makes it possible to use saturating nonlinearities
by preventing the network from getting stuck in the
saturated modes.
In Sec. 4.2, we apply Batch Normalization to the bestperforming
ImageNet classification network, and show that
we can match its performance using only 7% of the training
steps, and can further exceed its accuracy by a substantial
margin. Using an ensemble of such networks trained with
Batch Normalization, we achieve the top-5 error rate that
improves upon the best known results on ImageNet classification.
2. Towards Reducing Internal Covariate Shift
We define Internal Covariate Shift as the change in the distribution
of network activations due to the change in network
parameters during training. To improve the training,
we seek to reduce the internal covariate shift. By fixing
the distribution of the layer inputs x as the training progresses,
we expect to improve the training speed. It has
been long known (LeCun et al., 1998b; Wiesler & Ney,
2011) that the network training converges faster if its inputs
are whitened – i.e., linearly transformed to have zero
means and unit variances, and decorrelated. As each layer
observes the inputs produced by the layers below, it would
be advantageous to achieve the same whitening of the inputs
of each layer. By whitening the inputs to each layer,
we would take a step towards achieving the fixed distributions
of inputs that would remove the ill effects of the
internal covariate shift.
We could consider whitening activations at every training
step or at some interval, either by modifying the network
directly or by changing the parameters of the optimization
algorithm to depend on the network activation values
(Wiesler et al., 2014; Raiko et al., 2012; Povey et al., 2014;
Desjardins & Kavukcuoglu). However, if these modifications
are interspersed with the optimization steps, then the
gradient descent step may attempt to update the parameters
in a way that requires the normalization to be updated,
which reduces the effect of the gradient step. For example,
consider a layer with the input u that adds the learned bias
b, and normalizes the result by subtracting the mean of the
activation computed over the training data: xb = x − E[x]
where x = u + b, X = {x1...N } is the set of values of x
over the training set, and E[x] = 1
N
PN
i=1 xi
. If a gradient
descent step ignores the dependence of E[x] on b, then
it will update b ← b + ∆b, where ∆b ∝ −∂`/∂xb. Then
u + (b + ∆b) − E[u + (b + ∆b)] = u + b − E[u + b]. Thus,
the combination of the update to b and subsequent change
in normalization led to no change in the output of the layer
nor, consequently, the loss. As the training continues, b
will grow indefinitely while the loss remains fixed. This
problem can get worse if the normalization not only centers
but also scales the activations. We have observed this
Batch Normalization
empirically in initial experiments, where the model blows
up when the normalization parameters are computed outside
the gradient descent step.
The issue with the above approach is that the gradient descent
optimization does not take into account the fact that
the normalization takes place. To address this issue, we
would like to ensure that, for any parameter values, the network
always produces activations with the desired distribution.
Doing so would allow the gradient of the loss with
respect to the model parameters to account for the normalization,
and for its dependence on the model parameters Θ.
Let again x be a layer input, treated as a vector, and X be
the set of these inputs over the training data set. The normalization
can then be written as a transformation
bx = Norm(x, X )
which depends not only on the given training example x
but on all examples X – each of which depends on Θ
if x is generated by another layer. For backpropagation,
we would need to compute the Jacobians ∂Norm(x,X )
∂x
and
∂Norm(x,X )
∂X
; ignoring the latter term would lead to the explosion
described above. Within this framework, whitening
the layer inputs is expensive, as it requires computing
the covariance matrix Cov[x] = Ex∈X [xxT
] − E[x]E[x]T
and its inverse square root, to produce the whitened activations
Cov[x]−1/2
(x − E[x]), as well as the derivatives of
these transforms for backpropagation. This motivates us to
seek an alternative that performs input normalization in a
way that is differentiable and does not require the analysis
of the entire training set after every parameter update.
Some of the previous approaches (e.g. (Lyu & Simoncelli,
2008)) use statistics computed over a single training example,
or, in the case of image networks, over different feature
maps at a given location. However, this changes the representation
ability of a network by discarding the absolute
scale of activations. We want to a preserve the information
in the network, by normalizing the activations in a training
example relative to the statistics of the entire training data.
3. Normalization via Mini-Batch Statistics
Since the full whitening of each layer’s inputs is costly, we
make two necessary simplifications. The first is that instead
of whitening the features in layer inputs and outputs jointly,
we will normalize each scalar feature independently, by
making it have zero mean and unit variance. For a layer
with d-dimensional input x = (x
(1) . . . x(d)
), we will normalize
each dimension
xb
(k) =
x
(k) − E[x
(k)
]
p
Var[x
(k)
]
where the expectation and variance are computed over the
training data set. As shown in (LeCun et al., 1998b), such
normalization speeds up convergence, even when the features
are not decorrelated.
Note that simply normalizing each input of a layer may
change what the layer can represent. For instance, normalizing
the inputs of a sigmoid would constrain them to
the linear regime of the nonlinearity. To address this, we
make sure that the transformation inserted in the network
can represent the identity transform. To accomplish this,
we introduce, for each activation x
(k)
, a pair of parameters
γ
(k)
, β(k)
, which scale and shift the normalized value:
y
(k) = γ
(k)xb
(k) + β
(k)
.
These parameters are learned along with the original model
parameters, and restore the representation power of the network.
Indeed, by setting γ
(k) =
p
Var[x
(k)
] and β
(k) =
E[x
(k)
], we could recover the original activations, if that
were the optimal thing to do.
In the batch setting where each training step is based on
the entire training set, we would use the whole set to normalize
activations. However, this is impractical when using
stochastic optimization. Therefore, we make the second
simplification: since we use mini-batches in stochastic
gradient training, each mini-batch produces estimates
of the mean and variance of each activation. This way,
the statistics used for normalization can fully participate in
the gradient backpropagation. Note that the use of minibatches
is enabled by computation of per-dimension variances
rather than joint covariances; in the joint case, regularization
would be required since the mini-batch size is
likely to be smaller than the number of activations being
whitened, resulting in singular covariance matrices.
Consider a mini-batch B of size m. Since the normalization
is applied to each activation independently, let us focus on
a particular activation x
(k)
and omit k for clarity. We have
m values of this activation in the mini-batch,
B = {x1...m}.
Let the normalized values be xb1...m, and their linear transformations
be y1...m. We refer to the transform
BNγ,β : x1...m → y1...m
as the Batch Normalizing Transform. We present the BN
Transform in Algorithm 1. In the algorithm,  is a constant
added to the mini-batch variance for numerical stability.
The BN transform can be added to a network to manipulate
any activation. In the notation y = BNγ,β(x), we
indicate that the parameters γ and β are to be learned, but
it should be noted that the BN transform does not independently
process the activation in each training example.
Rather, BNγ,β(x) depends both on the training example
and the other examples in the mini-batch. The scaled and

shifted values y are passed to other network layers. The
normalized activations xb are internal to our transformation,
but their presence is crucial. The distributions of values
of any xb has the expected value of 0 and the variance of
1, as long as the elements of each mini-batch are sampled
from the same distribution, and if we neglect . This can be
seen by observing that Pm

, followed by
the other processing done by the original network. These
sub-network inputs all have fixed means and variances, and
although the joint distribution of these normalized xb

can
change over the course of training, we expect that the introduction
of normalized inputs accelerates the training of the
sub-network and, consequently, the network as a whole.
During training we need to backpropagate the gradient of
loss ` through this transformation, as well as compute the
gradients with respect to the parameters of the BN transform.

Thus, BN transform is a differentiable transformation that
introduces normalized activations into the network. This
ensures that as the model is training, layers can continue
learning on input distributions that exhibit less internal covariate
shift, thus accelerating the training. Furthermore,
the learned affine transform applied to these normalized activations
allows the BN transform to represent the identity
transformation and preserves the network capacity.
3.1. Training and Inference with Batch-Normalized
Networks
To Batch-Normalize a network, we specify a subset of activations
and insert the BN transform for each of them, according
to Alg. 1. Any layer that previously received x
as the input, now receives BN(x). A model employing
Batch Normalization can be trained using batch gradient
descent, or Stochastic Gradient Descent with a mini-batch
size m > 1, or with any of its variants such as Adagrad
(Duchi et al., 2011). The normalization of activations that
depends on the mini-batch allows efficient training, but is
neither necessary nor desirable during inference; we want
the output to depend only on the input, deterministically.
For this, once the network has been trained, we use the
normalization
xb =
x − E[x]
p
Var[x] + 
using the population, rather than mini-batch, statistics. Neglecting
, these normalized activations have the same
mean 0 and variance 1 as during training. We use the unbiased
variance estimate Var[x] = m
m−1
· EB[σ

], where the
expectation is over training mini-batches of size m and σ
2
B
are their sample variances. Using moving averages instead,
we can track the accuracy of a model as it trains. Since the
means and variances are fixed during inference, the normalization
is simply a linear transform applied to each activation.
It may further be composed with the scaling by
γ and shift by β, to yield a single linear transform that replaces
BN(x). Algorithm 2 summarizes the procedure for
training batch-normalized networks.
3.2. Batch-Normalized Convolutional Networks
Batch Normalization can be applied to any set of activations
in the network. Here, we focus on transforms that
consist of an affine transformation followed by an elementwise
nonlinearity:
z = g(Wu + b)
where W and b are learned parameters of the model, and
g(·) is the nonlinearity such as sigmoid or ReLU. This
formulation covers both fully-connected and convolutional
layers. We add the BN transform immediately before the
nonlinearity, by normalizing x = Wu + b. We could have
also normalized the layer inputs u, but since u is likely
the output of another nonlinearity, the shape of its distribution
is likely to change during training, and constraining
its first and second moments would not eliminate the covariate
shift. In contrast, Wu + b is more likely to have
a symmetric, non-sparse distribution, that is “more Gaus-

sian” (Hyvarinen & Oja ¨ , 2000); normalizing it is likely to
produce activations with a stable distribution.
Note that, since we normalize Wu + b, the bias b can be
ignored since its effect will be canceled by the subsequent
mean subtraction (the role of the bias is subsumed by β in
Alg. 1). Thus, z = g(Wu + b) is replaced with
z = g(BN(Wu))
where the BN transform is applied independently to each
dimension of x = Wu, with a separate pair of learned parameters
γ
(k)
, β
(k) per dimension.
For convolutional layers, we additionally want the normalization
to obey the convolutional property – so that different
elements of the same feature map, at different locations,
are normalized in the same way. To achieve this, we jointly
normalize all the activations in a mini-batch, over all locations.
In Alg. 1, we let B be the set of all values in a
feature map across both the elements of a mini-batch and
spatial locations – so for a mini-batch of size m and feature
maps of size p × q, we use the effective mini-batch of size
m0 = |B| = m· p q. We learn a pair of parameters γ
(k)
and
β
(k) per feature map, rather than per activation. Alg. 2 is
modified similarly, so that during inference the BN transform
applies the same linear transformation to each activation
in a given feature map.
3.3. Batch Normalization enables higher learning rates
In traditional deep networks, too high a learning rate may
result in the gradients that explode or vanish, as well as getting
stuck in poor local minima. Batch Normalization helps
address these issues. By normalizing activations throughout
the network, it prevents small changes in layer parameters
from amplifying as the data propagates through a deep
network. For example, this enables the sigmoid nonlinearities
to more easily stay in their non-saturated regimes,
which is crucial for training deep sigmoid networks but has
traditionally been hard to accomplish.
Batch Normalization also makes training more resilient to
the parameter scale. Normally, large learning rates may increase
the scale of layer parameters, which then amplify
the gradient during backpropagation and lead to the model
explosion. However, with Batch Normalization, backpropagation
through a layer is unaffected by the scale of its parameters.
Indeed, for a scalar a,
BN(Wu) = BN((aW)u)
and thus ∂BN((aW)u)
∂u =
∂BN(Wu)
∂u
, so the scale does not affect
the layer Jacobian nor, consequently, the gradient propagation.
Moreover, ∂BN((aW)u)
∂(aW) =
1
a
·
∂BN(Wu)
∂W , so larger
weights lead to smaller gradients, and Batch Normalization
will stabilize the parameter growth.
We further conjecture that Batch Normalization may lead
the layer Jacobians to have singular values close to 1, which
is known to be beneficial for training (Saxe et al., 2013).
Consider two consecutive layers with normalized inputs,
and the transformation between these normalized vectors:
bz = F(bx). If we assume that bx and bz are Gaussian and uncorrelated,
and that F(bx) ≈ Jbx is a linear transformation
for the given model parameters, then both bx and bz have unit
covariances, and I = Cov[bz] = JCov[bx]J
T = JJT
. Thus,
J is orthogonal, which preserves the gradient magnitudes
during backpropagation. Although the above assumptions
are not true in reality, we expect Batch Normalization to
help make gradient propagation better behaved. This remains
an area of further study.
4. Experiments
4.1. Activations over time
To verify the effects of internal covariate shift on training,
and the ability of Batch Normalization to combat it,
we considered the problem of predicting the digit class on
the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998a). We used a very
simple network, with a 28x28 binary image as input, and
3 fully-connected hidden layers with 100 activations each.
Each hidden layer computes y = g(Wu + b) with sigmoid
nonlinearity, and the weights W initialized to small random
Gaussian values. The last hidden layer is followe

by a fully-connected layer with 10 activations (one per
class) and cross-entropy loss. We trained the network for
50000 steps, with 60 examples per mini-batch. We added
Batch Normalization to each hidden layer of the network,
as in Sec. 3.1. We were interested in the comparison between
the baseline and batch-normalized networks, rather
than achieving the state of the art performance on MNIST
(which the described architecture does not).
Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of correct predictions by the
two networks on held-out test data, as training progresses.
The batch-normalized network enjoys the higher test accuracy.
To investigate why, we studied inputs to the sigmoid,
in the original network N and batch-normalized network

BN (Alg. 2) over the course of training. In Fig. 1(b,c) we
show, for one typical activation from the last hidden layer
of each network, how its distribution evolves. The distributions
in the original network change significantly over time,
both in their mean and the variance, which complicates the
training of the subsequent layers. In contrast, the distributions
in the batch-normalized network are much more
stable as training progresses, which aids the training.
4.2. ImageNet classification
We applied Batch Normalization to a new variant of the Inception
network (Szegedy et al., 2014), trained on the ImageNet
classification task (Russakovsky et al., 2014). The
network has a large number of convolutional and pooling
layers, with a softmax layer to predict the image class, out
of 1000 possibilities. Convolutional layers use ReLU as the
nonlinearity. The main difference to the network described
in (Szegedy et al., 2014) is that the 5×5 convolutional layers
are replaced by two consecutive layers of 3×3 convolutions
with up to 128 filters. The network contains 13.6·106
parameters, and, other than the top softmax layer, has no
fully-connected layers. We refer to this model as Inception
in the rest of the text. The training was performed on
a large-scale, distributed architecture (Dean et al., 2012),
using 5 concurrent steps on each of 10 model replicas, using
asynchronous SGD with momentum (Sutskever et al.,
2013), with the mini-batch size of 32. All networks are
evaluated as training progresses by computing the validation
accuracy @1, i.e. the probability of predicting the correct
label out of 1000 possibilities, on a held-out set, using
a single crop per image.
In our experiments, we evaluated several modifications of
Inception with Batch Normalization. In all cases, Batch
Normalization was applied to the input of each nonlinearity,
in a convolutional way, as described in section 3.2,
while keeping the rest of the architecture constant.
4.2.1. ACCELERATING BN NETWORKS
Simply adding Batch Normalization to a network does not
take full advantage of our method. To do so, we applied the
following modifications:
Increase learning rate. In a batch-normalized model, we
have been able to achieve a training speedup from higher
learning rates, with no ill side effects (Sec. 3.3).
Remove Dropout. We have found that removing Dropout
from BN-Inception allows the network to achieve higher
validation accuracy. We conjecture that Batch Normalization
provides similar regularization benefits as Dropout,
since the activations observed for a training example are
affected by the random selection of examples in the same
mini-batch.
Shuffle training examples more thoroughly. We enabled
within-shard shuffling of the training data, which prevents
the same examples from always appearing in a mini-batch
together. This led to about 1% improvement in the validation
accuracy, which is consistent with the view of Batch
Normalization as a regularizer: the randomization inherent
in our method should be most beneficial when it affects an
example differently each time it is seen.
Reduce the L2 weight regularization. While in Inception
an L2 loss on the model parameters controls overfitting, in
modified BN-Inception the weight of this loss is reduced
by a factor of 5. We find that this improves the accuracy on
the held-out validation data.
Accelerate the learning rate decay. In training Inception,
learning rate was decayed exponentially. Because our network
trains faster than Inception, we lower the learning rate
6 times faster.
Remove Local Response Normalization While Inception
and other networks (Srivastava et al., 2014) benefit from it,
we found that with Batch Normalization it is not necessary.
Reduce the photometric distortions. Because batchnormalized
networks train faster and observe each training
example fewer times, we let the trainer focus on more
“real” images by distorting them less.

4.2.2. SINGLE-NETWORK CLASSIFICATION
We evaluated the following networks, all trained on the
LSVRC2012 training data, and tested on the validation
data:
Inception: the network described at the beginning of Section
4.2, trained with the initial learning rate of 0.0015.
BN-Baseline: Same as Inception with Batch Normalization
before each nonlinearity.
BN-x5: Inception with Batch Normalization and the modifications
in Sec. 4.2.1. The initial learning rate was increased
by a factor of 5, to 0.0075. The same learning rate
increase with original Inception caused the model parameters
to reach machine infinity.
BN-x30: Like BN-x5, but with the initial learning rate
0.045 (30 times that of Inception).
BN-x5-Sigmoid: Like BN-x5, but with sigmoid nonlinearity
g(t) = 1
1+exp(−x)
instead of ReLU. We also attempted
to train the original Inception with sigmoid, but the model
remained at the accuracy equivalent to chance.
In Figure 2, we show the validation accuracy of the networks,
as a function of the number of training steps. Inception
reached the accuracy of 72.2% after 31 · 106
training
steps. The Figure 3 shows, for each network, the number of
training steps required to reach the same 72.2% accuracy,
as well as the maximum validation accuracy reached by the
network and the number of steps to reach it.
By only using Batch Normalization (BN-Baseline), we
match the accuracy of Inception in less than half the number
of training steps. By applying the modifications in
Sec. 4.2.1, we significantly increase the training speed of
the network. BN-x5 needs 14 times fewer steps than Inception
to reach the 72.2% accuracy. Interestingly, increasing
the learning rate further (BN-x30) causes the model to train
somewhat slower initially, but allows it to reach a higher
final accuracy. This phenomenon is counterintuitive and
should be investigated further. BN-x30 reaches 74.8% after
6 · 106
steps, i.e. 5 times fewer steps than required by
Inception to reach 72.2%.
We also verified that the reduction in internal covariate
shift allows deep networks with Batch Normalization
to be trained when sigmoid is used as the nonlinearity,
despite the well-known difficulty of training such networks.
Indeed, BN-x5-Sigmoid achieves the accuracy of
69.8%. Without Batch Normalization, Inception with sigmoid
never achieves better than 1/1000 accuracy.
4.2.3. ENSEMBLE CLASSIFICATION
The current reported best results on the ImageNet Large
Scale Visual Recognition Competition are reached by the
Deep Image ensemble of traditional models (Wu et al.,
2015) and the ensemble model of (He et al., 2015). The
latter reports the top-5 error of 4.94%, as evaluated by the
ILSVRC test server. Here we report a test error of 4.82%
on test server. This improves upon the previous best result,
and exceeds the estimated accuracy of human raters
according to (Russakovsky et al., 2014).
For our ensemble, we used 6 networks. Each was based
on BN-x30, modified via some of the following: increased
initial weights in the convolutional layers; using Dropout
(with the Dropout probability of 5% or 10%, vs. 40% for
the original Inception); and using non-convolutional Batch
Normalization with last hidden layers of the model. Each
network achieved its maximum accuracy after about 6 · 106
training steps. The ensemble prediction was based on the
arithmetic average of class probabilities predicted by the
constituent networks. The details of ensemble and multicrop
inference are similar to (Szegedy et al., 2014).
We demonstrate in Fig. 4 that batch normalization allows
us to set new state-of-the-art on the ImageNet classification
challenge benchmarks.

5. Conclusion
We have presented a novel mechanism for dramatically accelerating
the training of deep networks. It is based on the
premise that covariate shift, which is known to complicate
the training of machine learning systems, also applies to
sub-networks and layers, and removing it from internal activations
of the network may aid in training. Our proposed
method draws its power from normalizing activations, and
from incorporating this normalization in the network architecture
itself. This ensures that the normalization is appropriately
handled by any optimization method that is being
used to train the network. To enable stochastic optimization
methods commonly used in deep network training, we
perform the normalization for each mini-batch, and backpropagate
the gradients through the normalization parameters.
Batch Normalization adds only two extra parameters
per activation, and in doing so preserves the representation
ability of the network. We presented an algorithm
for constructing, training, and performing inference with
batch-normalized networks. The resulting networks can be
trained with saturating nonlinearities, are more tolerant to
increased training rates, and often do not require Dropout
for regularization.
Merely adding Batch Normalization to a state-of-the-art
image classification model yields a substantial speedup in
training. By further increasing the learning rates, removing
Dropout, and applying other modifications afforded by
Batch Normalization, we reach the previous state of the
art with only a small fraction of training steps – and then
beat the state of the art in single-network image classification.
Furthermore, by combining multiple models trained
with Batch Normalization, we perform better than the best
known system on ImageNet, by a significant margin.
Our method bears similarity to the standardization layer of
(Gulc¸ehre & Bengio ¨ , 2013), though the two address different
goals. Batch Normalization seeks a stable distribution
of activation values throughout training, and normalizes
the inputs of a nonlinearity since that is where matching
the moments is more likely to stabilize the distribution.
On the contrary, the standardization layer is applied to the
output of the nonlinearity, which results in sparser activations.
We have not observed the nonlinearity inputs to
be sparse, neither with nor without Batch Normalization.
Other notable differences of Batch Normalization include
the learned scale and shift that allow the BN transform
to represent identity, handling of convolutional layers, and
deterministic inference that does not depend on the minibatch.
In this work, we have not explored the full range of possibilities
that Batch Normalization potentially enables. Our
future work includes applications of our method to Recurrent
Neural Networks (Pascanu et al., 2013), where the internal
covariate shift and the vanishing or exploding gradients
may be especially severe, and which would allow us
to more thoroughly test the hypothesis that normalization
improves gradient propagation (Sec. 3.3). More study is
needed of the regularization properties of Batch Normalization,
which we believe to be responsible for the improvements
we have observed when Dropout is removed
from BN-Inception. We plan to investigate whether Batch
Normalization can help with domain adaptation, in its traditional
sense – i.e. whether the normalization performed
by the network would allow it to more easily generalize to
new data distributions, perhaps with just a recomputation
of the population means and variances (Alg. 2). Finally,
we believe that further theoretical analysis of the algorithm
would allow still more improvements and applications.
